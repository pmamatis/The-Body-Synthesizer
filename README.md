Welcome to our lovely project. THE BODY-SYNTHESIZER. This is an educational project, which has been the topic of a course in digital signal processing and electronics at the Technical University Berlin, and is for non-commercial use only. The main goal of the project was to realize a digital audio-synthesizer, which can be controlled by various analog sensors. In case you wanna have a quick overview about the functionality, you can access the following YouTube-link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzIIO2eS0HQ&t=1586s

\label{group__groupSVM}\index{SVM Functions@{SVM Functions}}
This set of functions is implementing SVM classification on 2 classes. The training must be done from scikit-\/learn. The parameters can be easily generated from the scikit-\/learn object. Some examples are given in DSP/\+Testing/\+Pattern\+Generation/\+SVM.\+py

If more than 2 classes are needed, the functions in this folder will have to be used, as building blocks, to do multi-\/class classification.

No multi-\/class classification is provided in this SVM folder.

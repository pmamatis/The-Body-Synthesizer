Welcome to our lovely project. THE BODY-\/\+SYNTHESIZER. This is an educational project, which has been the topic of a course in digital signal processing and electronics at the Technical University Berlin, and is for non-\/commercial use only. The main goal of the project was to realize a digital audio-\/synthesizer, which can be controlled by various analog sensors. In case you wanna have a quick overview about the functionality, you can access the following You\+Tube-\/link\+: \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzIIO2eS0HQ&t=1586s}{\texttt{ https\+://www.\+youtube.\+com/watch?v=\+Vz\+IIO2e\+S0\+HQ\&t=1586s}}
